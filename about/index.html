I was born and raised in Nepal, a country known for Himalaya and the birthplace of Buddha. I completed my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Agriculture science with minor in plant breeding.
I then joined West Virginia State University (WVSU) for my MS in Biotechnology. At WVSU, I worked on improving vintage tomato varieties using Marker assisted selection and background selection. I also worked on incompatibility issues while crossing heirlooms with the commercial variety."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/Dinesh_website/ananke/css/main.min.efe4d852f731d5d1fbb87718387202a97aafd768cdcdaed0662bbe6982e91824.css><link rel=canonical href=https://dineshghimire01.github.io/Dinesh_website/about/><meta property="og:url" content="https://dineshghimire01.github.io/Dinesh_website/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Hi, I am "><meta property="og:title" content="About Dinesh"><meta property="og:description" content="Namaskar/Greetings Fellow’s:

The overall goal is to improve predictive breeding that accelerates development of high-yielding, climate-resilient, and stable crop varieties.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://dineshghimire01.github.io/Dinesh_website/>&copy; Hi, I am 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
