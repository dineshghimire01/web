Namaskar/Greetings Fellow's:

I was born and raised in Nepal, a country known for Himalaya and the birthplace of Buddha. I completed my bachelor's degree in Agriculture science with minor in plant breeding. 

I then joined West Virginia State University (WVSU) for my MS in Biotechnology. At WVSU, I worked on improving vintage tomato varieties using Marker assisted selection and background selection. I also worked on incompatibility issues while crossing heirlooms with the commercial variety. 

After graduating from WVSU in Spring of 2023, I joined Cornell University for my doctoral degree in plant breeding and genetics from Fall 2023. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Robbins lab. 

My research brings together phenomics, genomics, and enviromics with advanced statistical models to improve phenotyping (especially with UAVs), better capture plant–environment interactions and build tools that turn high-throughput data into selection decisions. The overall goal is to improve predictive breeding that accelerates development of high-yielding, climate-resilient, and stable crop varieties.
